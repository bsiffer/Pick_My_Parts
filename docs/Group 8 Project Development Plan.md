Project Goal
Provide a tool that allows users to generate a list of personal computer parts that are compatible with each other for the planning of a computer build.

Project Objectives
Allow users to accomplish 3 different tasks:
* Generate a list of compatible computer parts within a specific budget.
* Allow the user to manually create a list of computer parts and check for part compatibility.
* Allow an administrative user to add and remove parts from the database of available computer parts.

Project Scope
The product's main scope is to create an interface that allows users to generate a computer parts list that checks for compatibility from a database of listed parts.
Additional features that are out of scope could include user accounts, auto-fill capabilities, and price comparison tools.

Project Assumptions
The assumption for this project is that the user has a basic knowledge of what computer parts they need to complete a PC computer build. Users will expect modern parts that are widely available for purchase as new products.

Project Constraints
A capable, backed database for the storage of available computer parts along with an internet connection to access the application

Project Resources Required
We will be using Python as our main language and MariaDB for our database of computer parts.

Team Collaboration and Communication 
We will be using Microsoft Teams for communication, Trello for project planning, and GitHub for version control.

Project Documentation 
We will be using Teams to keep track of documentation during the course of our product's development.

Project Management Plan and Methodologies
We will be using the AGILE methodology for our product's development, breaking our work down into several 2-week sprints to allow for a fluid development process that is adaptable to any problems that arise during the course of development.
